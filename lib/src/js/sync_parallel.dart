/// Synchronous bounded worker pool for frozen event-loop contexts
/// (gh-348 — Java `ConfluenceParallel` parity, dm.ai d61a4abd).
///
/// QuickJS `NativeCallable` callbacks freeze the calling isolate's event
/// loop, so `Future`-based parallelism can never complete there. Like
/// [SyncHttpBridge], this pool spawns worker isolates up front (while the
/// event loop is still alive), submits jobs over `SendPort`s (a native,
/// non-blocking send that works from a blocked FFI callback), and parks
/// the caller's OS thread on `Mailbox.take()` until every job answered.
///
/// Semantics mirror the Java helper:
/// - results keep the input order of the job list;
/// - a job that throws yields `null` instead of aborting the others;
/// - the concurrency bound is the worker count (each worker serves one
///   job at a time — sync HTTP blocks the worker thread, so real
///   parallelism needs N busy workers, not N tasks on one loop);
/// - a pool that was never booted reports `ready == false`; callers are
///   expected to fall back to running jobs inline on the calling isolate.
///
/// The worker entry must be a top-level (or static) function — like
/// `Isolate.spawn` entries everywhere it cannot capture instance state —
/// so each domain defines a tiny entry that delegates to [serveSyncWorker]
/// with its own [SyncWorkerRunner]. Runner closures cannot ride the spawn
/// message; the entry binds them in the worker isolate instead.
///
/// Transport: each job carries its own single-slot reply [Mailbox] (the
/// primitive is one-message deep, so a shared response mailbox cannot
/// serve concurrent workers); the caller collects replies in submission
/// order — already-finished jobs answer instantly, so collection costs
/// about as much as the slowest job.
///
/// Boot discipline: [boot] must complete while the event loop is alive
/// (the CLI awaits it at startup, next to `SyncHttpBridge.shared.boot()`).
/// Workers additionally warm their per-isolate [SyncHttpBridge] so their
/// HTTP calls reuse pooled connections instead of spawning one curl
/// process per request.
